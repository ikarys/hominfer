Run local AI models like home services. Paste a Hugging Face repo and it tells you which variants fit
your GPU, installs the engine you're missing, and gives every model a card to start, stop and profile —
with live VRAM, RAM, CPU and GPU load.

Engine-agnostic by design: llama.cpp, vLLM, Ninfer and friends are configuration, not code.
Linux / WSL2, NVIDIA.

## Features

- **Start / stop models** with profiles (context size, parallel sessions, vision, CPU or GPU…), from any
  browser on your LAN
- **Live usage**: VRAM per model (inferred, since `nvidia-smi` under WSL doesn't report per-process
  memory), RAM, CPU, GPU load and temperature
- **Hugging Face browser**: paste a repository and get a "does it run here?" verdict for every variant,
  based on your GPU, your installed engines and free disk, then download what fits
- **Engine catalog**: install llama.cpp, vLLM and others from the page when a model needs one, with no
  sudo (the CUDA toolkit comes from NVIDIA's pip wheels)
- **Library**: every model file of your models folder, which model uses it, and cleanup
- **Settings**: UI language (English, French), theme (auto, light, dark, cyber, pixel, neo), models folder
- Port conflict detection; the models the launcher started stop with it
- The machine doesn't go to sleep while a model is loaded (Windows under WSL, systemd-logind on Linux)

## Requirements

- Linux or WSL2 (Ubuntu tested), with systemd for the optional boot service
- An NVIDIA GPU with its driver (`nvidia-smi`). The page still works without one, but most engines need it
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Python and the venvs) and [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
  (the commands below)
- To build engines from the catalog: `sudo apt install git cmake ninja-build build-essential`

## Getting started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ikarys/hominfer.git
cd hominfer
just run              # http://localhost:8090, also reachable from the LAN
```

`run.sh` creates the launcher's venv on the first run and keeps it in sync with `requirements.txt`.
On first start there is no model and no engine yet:

1. **Settings → Inference engines**: install an engine (llama.cpp is the most versatile)
2. **Models → Download from Hugging Face**: paste a repository, pick a variant that fits, download it
3. **Library → Add as a model**, then start it from the **Dashboard**

To start the launcher when the machine (or WSL) boots:

```sh
just install-service  # systemd service; then: just logs-service, just restart
```
